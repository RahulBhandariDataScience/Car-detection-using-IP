# 🚗 Car Detection using MATLAB

This project uses image processing techniques in MATLAB to detect cars in input images. The logic is implemented in a single `.m` script.

## 🔍 Features
- Image pre-processing
- Object detection using MATLAB built-in functions
- Annotated output images

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- MATLAB R2023a (or compatible version)
- Image Processing Toolbox

## 📁 Project Structure
- `src/Assignment_291755.m`: Main script file
- `images/`: Input and output images
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Software/toolbox dependencies

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `Assignment_291755.m` in MATLAB
2. Make sure required images are placed in the `images/` folder
3. Run the script to see detection output
